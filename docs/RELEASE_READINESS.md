# Release Readiness

## Automated Gates

Required before a release candidate is published:

- Full Release build succeeds.
- Full CTest suite passes with zero failures.
- Secret scan passes.
- Blocking-pattern guard passes.
- Third-party license audit passes.
- QRC resource verification passes.
- Portable package smoke passes from a clean extracted folder.
- Startup E2E smoke passes from the packaged folder.
- All packaged `.exe` and `.dll` files have valid Authenticode signatures.
- `SHA256SUMS.txt` is regenerated after signing.

Use:

```powershell
$version = (Get-Content VERSION -Raw).Trim()
$packageName = "SAK-Utility-v$version"

powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/stage_portable_release.ps1 `
  -BuildDir build\Release `
  -PackageName $packageName

powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/create_release_archive.ps1 `
  -BuildDir build\Release `
  -PackageName $packageName

$extract = "build\Release\clean-readiness-extract"
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force $extract -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path $extract | Out-Null
Expand-Archive -LiteralPath "build\Release\$packageName-Windows-x64.zip" -DestinationPath $extract -Force

powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/check_release_readiness.ps1 `
  -PackageRoot $extract `
  -RequireSignedPackage
```

`check_release_readiness.ps1` expects a clean package folder. Startup smoke
creates normal runtime folders such as `data\logs` and `data\temp`, so run the
aggregate readiness gate against a fresh extract when validating the ZIP.

## Clean VM Manual QA

Run on a fresh Windows 10/11 x64 VM with no repo checkout and no developer
environment variables:

1. Extract the release ZIP into a clean folder.
2. Run `sak_utility.exe`.
3. Confirm the app starts without Qt/plugin/runtime errors.
4. Confirm `data\logs` is created under the portable folder.
5. Open AI Assistant and confirm provider diagnostics render.
6. Run a package search request and verify no install occurs.
7. Run package install request only after explicit install wording.
8. Run Network Diagnostics ping/DNS/port-scan safe tools.
9. Run Diagnostics hardware scan and generate a report.
10. Run Backup wizard dry path through validation without writing outside the selected target.
11. Run App Management scan/export.
12. Confirm About panel includes third-party attribution.
13. Close and reopen the app; verify settings and sessions remain portable.
14. Verify no files are written under the source repo or developer profile except standard Windows logs.

## Rollback And Versioning

- Release tags must use `v<major>.<minor>.<patch>.<build>` and match `VERSION`.
- A release is rollback-safe only when the previous signed ZIP remains available.
- If a release is pulled, mark the GitHub release as draft or delete the asset,
  publish a replacement patch version, and document the reason in release notes.
- Never overwrite a published ZIP for the same tag. Rebuilds require a new tag.
- Keep at least one previous known-good release artifact available.

## App-Control Rule

App-control workflows ship only when the manifest action is backed by either:

- a documented CLI with tested arguments, or
- a tested Win32 GUI automation workflow with stable selectors and failure
  evidence.

If neither exists, the manifest must expose observation/status only and fail
explicitly for the unsupported action.
